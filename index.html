                <p>The grizzly bear, also known as the North American brown bear or simply grizzly,
                    is a population or subspecies of the brown bear inhabiting North America.
                    In addition to the mainland grizzly, other morphological forms of brown bear
                    in North America are sometimes identified as grizzly bears.

                    It is the continent's smallest and most widely distributed bear species.
                    The American black bear is an omnivore, with a diet varying greatly depending on season and
                    location.

                <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa.
                    It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth.
                    Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa camelopardalis,
                    with nine subspecies. Click <a href="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/giraffe"

                <p>Though giraffes as a species are not considered endangered,
                    some giraffe subspecies are. Out of eight assessed subspecies,
                    two—the reticulated giraffe and the Masai giraffe—are classified as endangered.
                    Another two, the Kordofan giraffe and the Nubian giraffe, are critically endangered.

                <p>A female lion is called a lioness. Lionesses are the main hunters in a pride,
                    and they are responsible for defending the pride's territory and raising their cubs.

                <p>The rhesus macaque, colloquially rhesus monkey, is a species of Old World monkey.
                    There are between six and nine recognised subspecies that are split between two groups,
                    the Chinese-derived and the Indian-derived. Hardy in captivity,
                    the rhesus monkey is a highly intelligent, lively animal that is docile when young but may become
                    bad-tempered as an adult.

                    part of the subfamily Atelinae, family Atelidae. Like other atelines,
                    they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Brazil.

                <p>Orangutans are great apes native to the rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia.
                    They are now found only in parts of Borneo and Sumatra, but during the Pleistocene they ranged
                    throughout Southeast Asia and South China.
                    Classified in the genus Pongo, orangutans were originally considered to be one species.

                <p>The American alligator, sometimes referred to as a gator or common alligator,
                    is a large crocodilian reptile native to the Southeastern United States and a small section of
                    northeastern Mexico.

                <p>Albino alligators are alligators that lack the ability to produce melanin in their skin.
                    This genetic defect gives their skin a yellowish white appearance and the eyes generally
                    cast a pinkish hue due to the visible blood vessels in the colorless irises. This lack of pigment,
                    though viewed as beautiful, has its downside. Most albino alligators rarely make it to adulthood
                    because they are not able to camouflage themselves making them an easy target in the wild.
                    Their skin is said to be extremely sensitive to sunlight in which too much sun will burn their skin.

                <p>The Chinese alligator, also known as the Yangtze alligator, China alligator,
                    or historically the muddy dragon, is a crocodilian endemic to China.
                    It and the American alligator are the only living species in the genus Alligator of the family
                    Alligatoridae.
